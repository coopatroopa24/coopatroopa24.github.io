My name is Caleb Cooper, and I was born and raised in Flowood, Mississippi.  I recently graduated with honors and a 4.0 GPA from Northwest Rankin High School. I would like to think that I am a very calm and caring person. Throughout my high school career, I have been an active community volunteer. I have helped out with Salvation Army, Goodwill, and Central Mississippi Down Syndrome Society. I was also very active in my schoolâ€™s student government, as I was the student body president. In the fall, I plan to attend Tougaloo College and major in biology, and after that I plan to attend medical school. My aspiration is to become a sports medicine doctor. Helping people has always been a passion of mine, and doing it around a sports environment would be even better. 
My very first job, which is the job I currently have, is being a referee. It has taught me how to interact with other professionals, and make difficult decisions under pressure. After 4 years of my experience of refereeing, I believe I have mastered making hard decisions quickly. This skill will carry over nicely when I am in the healthcare field.
